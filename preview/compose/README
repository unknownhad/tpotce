This folder contains docker-compose.yml files, basically referring to installation types.

Just copy the .yml file you want to use over the on in the parent folder, but unload docker compose first:
> $ docker compose down -v
> $ cd compose
> $ cp standard.yml ../docker-compose.yml

For Docker Desktop on macOS and Windows machines is only one .yml available "mac_win.yml" which is a stripped down
version of T-Pot able to run with the constraints of Docker Desktop.
